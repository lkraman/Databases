1) Write out a generic SELECT statement.

    SELECT <column1, column2, ... *>
    FROM <table1, table2 ...>
    <optional: WHERE <condition>>

2) Create a fun way to remember the order of operations in a SELECT statement, such as a mnemonic.

    SFW=Safe for work
    SFW=So effing what

3) Given this dogs table, write queries to select the following pieces of data:

Intake teams typically guess the breed of shelter dogs, so the breed column may have multiple words (for example, "Labrador Collie mix").

3a) Display the name, gender, and age of all dogs that are part Labrador.

    SELECT name, gender, age
    FROM dogs
    WHERE breed LIKE '%labrador%';


3b) Display the ids of all dogs that are under 1 year old.

    SELECT id
    FROM dogs
    WHERE age < 1;

3c) Display the name and age of all dogs that are female and over 35lbs.

    SELECT name, age
    FROM dogs
    WHERE gender= 'F'
    AND weight > 35;

3d) Display all of the information about all dogs that are not Shepherd mixes.

    SELECT *
    FROM dogs
    WHERE breed NOT LIKE '%shepherd%';

3e) Display the id, age, weight, and breed of all dogs that are either over 60lbs or Great Danes.

    SELECT id, age, weight, breed
    FROM dogs
    WHERE weight > 60
    OR breed LIKE '%great dane%';

4) Given this cats table, what records are returned from these queries?

4a) SELECT name, adoption_date FROM cats;

    Mushi	2016-03-22T00:00:00.000Z
    Seashell	null
    Azul	2016-04-17T00:00:00.000Z
    Victoire	2016-09-01T00:00:00.000Z
    Nala	null

4b) SELECT name, age FROM cats;

    Mushi	1
    Seashell	7
    Azul	3
    Victoire	7
    Nala	1

5) From the cats table, write queries to select the following pieces of data.

5a) Display all the information about all of the available cats.

    SELECT *
    FROM cats;

    id	name	gender	age	intake_date	adoption_date
1	Mushi	M	1	2016-01-09T00:00:00.000Z	2016-03-22T00:00:00.000Z
2	Seashell	F	7	2016-01-09T00:00:00.000Z	null
3	Azul	M	3	2016-01-11T00:00:00.000Z	2016-04-17T00:00:00.000Z
4	Victoire	M	7	2016-01-11T00:00:00.000Z	2016-09-01T00:00:00.000Z
5	Nala	F	1	2016-01-12T00:00:00.000Z	null

5b) Display the name and sex of all cats who are 7 years old.

    SELECT name, gender
    FROM cats
    WHERE age > 7;

    No results

5c) Find all of the names of the cats, so you don’t choose duplicate names for new cats.

    SELECT names
    FROM cats

    Mushi
    Seashell
    Azul
    Victoire
    Nala

6) List each comparison operator and explain when you would use it. Include a real world example for each.
If you can’t list these from memory, do these flashcards until you can!

    > :'where age is greater than 15 so you're old enough to drive'
    < :'where height is less than 3 feet and you no longer can go on the kiddie rides'
    = :'when your age equals 40 so you start getting mail for AARP'
    >= :'when you are 55 and older, you can qualify for a 55 and older living community!'
    <= :'when you are 9 and under, that is the only time in your life you are aged as a single digit'
    != / <> :'My love for my cat, Sal, is greater than the love I have for a rock, but less than the love I have for my other cat, Syl.'
    LIKE :'%s%' 'the letter 's' is in both cats' names, Syl and Sal. '
    BETWEEN :'getting a web development job is my 'between' chaos and freedom'
    IS DISTINCT FROM :'The tree is distinct from the others because it has a knot the shape of Kentucky'
    IS TRUE / IS FALSE 'when the taxi has arrived, the statement is true. When the taxi is gone, it is false.'
    IS NULL 'when the taxi has not arrived nor left, it is null'
    AND 'It is ideal to cuddle with Syl and Sal.'
    OR 'I'd prefer to live in Southern United States or the Caribbean.'
    NOT 'when I enjoy climates that are not wintry'

7) From the cats table, what data is returned from these queries?

7a) SELECT name FROM cats WHERE gender = ‘F’;

    Seashell
    Nala

7b) SELECT name FROM cats WHERE age <> 3;

    Mushi
    Seashell
    Victoire
    Nala

7c) SELECT ID FROM cats WHERE name != ‘Mushi’ AND gender = ‘M’;

    id
    3
